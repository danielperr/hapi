## Installing With Git

:::note
Installing Git is not required, but it's highly encouraged if you are willing to
contribute to the project or make any changes.

If, however, you do not want to install Git you can
[download the source files instead](https://github.com/danielperr/hapi/archive/master.zip)
and [skip this part](#installing-npm).
:::


Check if you already have Git installed:

```bash
git --version
```

If Git is not installed, there are multiple ways to install it depending on your operating system.

import { isMacOs } from 'react-device-detect';
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  groupId="operating-systems"
  defaultValue={isMacOs ? "mac" : "win"}
  values={[
    { label: 'Windows', value: 'win' },
    { label: 'macOS', value: 'mac' },
    { label: 'Linux', value: 'linux' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="win">

[Download the Git installer for windows](http://git-scm.com/download/win)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac">

There are multiple options to install Git on a macOS.
[More info](http://git-scm.com/download/mac)

<h3>With Xcode</h3>

Apple ships a binary package of Git with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

Xcode is an app development suite for Apple's iOS, macOS, etc.

<h3>With Homebrew</h3>

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a helpful package manager for macOS.

If you don't have it, install it using the following command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then run

```bash
brew install git
```

<h3>With A Binary Installer</h3>

There are non-official binaries for Git that you can
[download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/).

<h3>For Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint</h3>

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

<h3>For Other Linux Distributions</h3>

Verify that Git is installed:

```bash
git --version
```


### Configuring Git for commits

Configure your Git username and email using the following commands.
These details will be associated with any commits that you create:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

### Downloading the project from GitHub

Finally, clone (download) the project's repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielperr/hapi
```

This will create a folder at your current location containing the project's files.

## Installing NPM

This project is built with [NPM](npm), so you will need to install it.

Check if you already have NPM installed:

```bash
npm -v
```

If NPM is installed, you can [skip](#installing-depencencies) this part of the page.
If NPM is not installed for you, follow the following steps.

NPM is shipped with Node, a JavaScript runtime engine, so its installation comes with the Node installation process:

    { label: 'macOS', value: 'mac' },
    { label: 'Linux', value: 'linux' },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="win">

Download Node from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version)
and follow the instructions. NPM Should be automatically installed with Node.

<TabItem value="mac">

Download Node from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version)

<h3>For Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint</h3>

Click [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-of-node-js-on-linux/) for more info.

Install Node.js:

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
```

Install NPM:

```bash
sudo apt install npm
```

<h3>For Other Linux Distributions</h3>

Follow the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for your distro.

</Tabs>

Verify that Node is installed:
```bash
node -v
```

Verify that npm is installed:
```bash
npm -v
```

## Installing depencencies

After [cloning with Git](#downloading-the-project-from-github) (or just downloading the files),
navigate to the project's root directory:

```bash
cd hapi
```

Every package has its own dependencies (NPM packages that it depends on).

There are 3 packages, located at `packages/` (see [Project Files and Folders](project-files-folders)):

* `hapi-activity`
* `hapi-creator`
* `hapi-docs`

The same following steps will work for each of the 2 other packages.
Here we will take as an example the `hapi-creator` package.

To install packages for `hapi-creator`, first navigate to it:

```bash
cd packages/hapi-creator
```

Then use NPM to install its dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will create the folder `node_modules`, containing the required packages.
