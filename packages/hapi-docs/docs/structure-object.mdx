title: The Structure Object
sidebar_label: Structure Object

The following is a concept which is used throughout the explanations of the activity and the creator, and
it's important to understand it in order to even understand the code alone.

The structure object is an object describing an activity. It defines its headers, its sections, elements,
visuals, questions and correct answers for these questions, and in general - it holds all the information needed
to display a fully functional activity in our format.

Every activity consists of sections, and each section consists of elements.
Each element has a type (text, image, question), as well as other properties.

Let's see an example of such a structure object:

At the root of the structure we describe the activity's properties, such as its name, its supported language,
its id, and the sections it contains.

Each section, similarly, has a name, an id, and the elements it contains.

And finally, each element describes its type, its id and its other relevant properties.

## Answers to Questions

Every question element that can be automatically checked by the activity (`multi-choice` & `number-input`)
have their correct answer in the structure.

### Multi Choice

```jsx {6}
{
  id: '...',
  type: 'multi-choice',
  text: '...',
  options: [...],
  correct: '...'
}
```

`correct` holds the ID of the correct option.
The activity checks if the student's selection matches the correct selection's ID.

### Number Input

```jsx {5-6}
{
  id: '...',
  type: 'number-input',
  text: '...',
  min: 3.10,
  max: 3.20
}
```

The correct answer here can be defined to be between a minimum and a maximum value,
in order to account for any computational inaccuracies.
