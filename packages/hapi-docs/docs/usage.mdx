All the apps in this repository (activity, creator, docs) are using `react-scripts`
to manage running, building and bundling.
You will have to use it exclusively for running and building each package.

Before continuing, make sure you've navigated inside one of the packages:

* `packages/hapi-activity`
* `packages/hapi-creator`
* `packages/hapi-docs`

The following commands will work the same for each of these 3 packages.

## Installing

To make sure you have the app's requirements, run:

```bash
npm install
```

NPM will look at `package.json` in the current directory and will figure out what to download
and in which version.

This will create the folder `node_modules`, containing the required packages.

## Running

While developing, you will certainly want to run the package to see the results of your changes.

To start the app, run:

```bash
npm start
```

`react-scripts` will then launch a development server which listens at `localhost:3000`.

Every time you change one of the app's source files, the site should refresh automatically.

The website you'll be viewing is in development mode (`NODE_ENV=development`),
which means that React is not optimized and isn't suited for running in production.

To export the app for production, you will need to [Build](#building) it.

## Building

Building will create final HTML and JS files to put in production.

To build a React app, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will bundle the app and export the final files to a directory named `build`.
Open `build/index.html` in the browser to see the app in production mode.

This process is done automatically with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
(a free website hosting service).
Every time the `master` branch in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/danielperr/hapi)
is updated, Netlify will run `npm build` in each app and deploy them to the internet.
